Document in a patterns.txt file in your root project directory.
List the pattern name, file(s) that contain the pattern, and relevant line numbers in that file.

Design Patterns:

1. Factory: Command Factory
Description: Factory to create different command instances based on what string is passed into the method.

Files:
    * src/main/java/umleditor/controller/utilities/CommandFactory.java


2. Builder: UMLBuilderController
Description: Builder Class to allow user to add and manipulate nodes in the GUI

Files:
    * src/main/java/umleditor/controller/UMLBuilderController.java


3. Model-View-Controller: Package Structure
Description: Package structure organizes code into three distinct categories, each only performing their required tasks.

Files:
    * src/main/java/umleditor
    * src/main/java/umleditor/controller
    * src/main/java/umleditor/model
    * src/main/java/umleditor/view


4. Builder: SimpleAutoComplete
Description: Create LineReader method in class, uses builder pattern to build a new line reader object. Uses JLine's
library builder pattern to create a modified linereader object for our purposes (lines 38-41)

Files:
    * src/main/java/umleditor/controller/utilities/SimpleAutoComplete.java


5. Singleton: Storage
Description: Singleton Storage class create a single instance of storage. Ensures that UMLEditor only has one
instance of Storage, and creates global access to the instance.

Files:
    * src/main/java/umleditor/model/utilities/Storage.java


6. Memento: undo/redo
Description: uses nested memento class inside UMLClass.java (lines 261-284), to create a memento object of a UMLClass.
This object gets stored inside an undo stack inside MementoStorage.java, until Functions calls to undo or redo a class,
then restoreFromMemento is called inside UMLClass (line 242) to restore the object to the previous state.

Files:
    * src/main/java/umleditor/model/uml/UMLClass
    * src/main/java/umleditor/controller/utilities/MementoStorage

7. Singleton: undo/redo
Description: Singleton memento storage class, has private constructor to ensure that functions can only call on one
instance of our undo redo stack storage.

Files:
    * src/main/java/umleditor/controller/utilities/MementoStorage

8. Singleton: UMLNodeManager
Description: Singleton of our UMLNodeManager class, stores all nodes in an array list

Files:
    * src/main/java/umleditor/view/UMLNodeManager

9. Factory: RelationshipLines
Description: GetLine() method is a factory, uses generic constructor createRelationshipLines
but makes different lines based on type.

Files:
    src/main/java/umleditor/view/gui/RelationshipLines
